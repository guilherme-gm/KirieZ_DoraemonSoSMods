This section contains a general user guide for installing and configuring
the mods available in this project.

It is meant for end users who simply wants to mod their game.

First of all, it is important that you have BepInEx v5 installed and configured
in your game. BepInEx website covers the installation steps very well, you may check it [clicking here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html).

!!! note

	You **MUST** use BepInEx version 5, DON'T download v6.


Once you have installed BepInEx to your Doraemon Story of Seasons game folder,
you may go on and install the mods you want.

Most (if not all) of my mods requires `kzModUtils` to be installed, this is a
mod that helps other mods be created, so be sure to install it if any of
your mods require it.

You can find a detailed installation guide in each mod page
