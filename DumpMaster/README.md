# Dump Master

Utility to dump the binary resources as text. This is a prototype and quite unstable.

## Installation
You must have BepInEx v5 installed on your game.
- [Download BepInEx v5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
	- [How to install BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)

<!-- After having it installed, download the latest version of the mod dll from the [Releases](https://github.com/guilherme-gm/KirieZ_DoraemonSoSMods/releases?q=Confirm+Beehive+Removal&expanded=true) page and add it to your BepInEx's plugins folder. -->

You will have to manually build this plugin.
